Hi there ! My name is Jaime. I'm a computer engineer passionate about android development and software engineering.

This is my blog. I write about android, entrepreneurship and random things that run into my mind :D  

Before I go ! I would like to leave you a quote that always motivates me:

 "Through every generation of the human race there has been a constant war, a war with fear. Those who have the courage to conquer it are made free and those who are conquered by it are made to suffer until they have the courage to defeat it, or death takes them.‚Äù - Alexander the Great
